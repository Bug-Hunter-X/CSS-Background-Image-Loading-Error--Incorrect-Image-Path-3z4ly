The solution is to verify the image path and ensure the image file exists at the correct location relative to the CSS file.  The corrected CSS rule should use a fully qualified path or a path relative to the CSS file's location.  Here's an example of a correct approach:

```css
/* Correct version: Uses a relative path */
image {  background-image: url('./images/image.jpg'); }

/* Correct version: Uses a fully qualified path */
image {  background-image: url('https://example.com/images/image.jpg'); }
```
